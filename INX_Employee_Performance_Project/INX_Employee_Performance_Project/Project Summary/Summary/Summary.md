# Project Summary and Recommendations

## Summary of Work
This project applied data science techniques to analyze employee performance at
INX Future Inc. The study combined exploratory analysis, machine learning modeling,
and business interpretation to identify key drivers of employee performance.

## Key Findings
- Employee performance varies across departments, suggesting systemic influences
  rather than individual shortcomings.
- Experience, job level, and satisfaction-related attributes are the strongest
  predictors of performance.
- Demographic attributes alone do not significantly explain performance variation.

## Model Outcome
A Random Forest classifier was developed to predict employee performance ratings
based on historical data. The model demonstrated stable performance on unseen test
data and provides an objective method for identifying potential performance risks.

## Business Recommendations
- Implement targeted training and mentorship programs
- Review workload distribution and role clarity in low-performing departments
- Use the predictive model during hiring and internal assessments
- Focus on performance improvement initiatives rather than punitive actions

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates that employee performance challenges are largely systemic
and can be addressed through data-driven interventions. The proposed solution enables
fair, transparent, and morale-safe decision-making aligned with INX Future Inc’s
organizational values.
